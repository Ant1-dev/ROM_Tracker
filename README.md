# Range of Motion Tracker (Qt C++)

This is a desktop application built with Qt and C++ for tracking **knee and hip joint range of motion (ROM)**. It allows clinicians or patients to:

- Enter patient information (name, date)
- Record joint measurements (start and end angles)
- Calculate and display ROM automatically
- Ensure input validation to prevent incorrect values

## Features

- Clean, professional GUI with three sections:
  - Patient Info
  - ROM Input
  - Results Display
- Styled using Qt StyleSheet for readability
- Supports knee and hip measurements
- Saves measurements for future enhancement (file/CSV support planned)

## Usage

1. Run the application in Qt Creator.
2. Enter patient name and measurement date.
3. Select joint type (knee or hip).
4. Enter start and end angles.
5. Click "Save Measurement" to calculate and display ROM.

## Future Improvements

- Save multiple measurements per patient
- Export to CSV or PDF
- Track ROM trends over time with charts
